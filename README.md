# An-Advanced-Email-Phishing-Simulation-Tool
This project is an advanced phishing simulation and security awareness platform using Gophish, Mailtrap, and Hotjar to track user interactions, analyze behavior with heatmaps and session recordings, score risk levels, and provide insights that strengthen overall cybersecurity readiness. It improves training and reduces user risk through insight.
Project Overview

This project is an Advanced Email Phishing Simulation & Behavioral Analytics Tool designed to evaluate user susceptibility to phishing attacks and understand how users behave during email-based social engineering attempts.

The system integrates:

Gophish → for phishing campaign creation & tracking

Mailtrap → for safe email delivery during testing

Hotjar → for behavioral analytics (heatmaps, sessions)

DigitalOcean → for cloud hosting

It provides end‑to‑end simulation, click‑level analysis, behavior recording, risk scoring, and security awareness insights.
